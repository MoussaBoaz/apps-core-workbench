# Workbench - Folder src/app/_components

The components in this folder are meant to be stand-alone components, designed to be shared between the various modules of the application via the shared module "Workbench."

They are independent from one another (and must remain so) but are bound to the WorkbenchApp and might not be exportable as-is for use in other projects.
